/**
 * Size of the optimal control problem to be solved with the HpipmInterface
 *
 * The number of stages (N) is defined as the number of transitions, the number of nodes, including terminal node, is therefore (N+1).
 *
 * For example, a problem with:
 * (t0, x0) -> dynamics driven by u0 ->  (t1, x1) -> dynamics driven by u1 -> (t2, x2)
 * Has 2 stages, and 3 nodes.
 *
 * HPIPM requires all sizes to be declared per node. All vectors therefore need to be of size N+1.
 * For the optimal control problems we are currently solving, we therefore set numInput(N+1) = 0.
